												<h2>Me</h2>
											</header>
											<p>Though I have spent most of my life in the United States, I still believe my immigrant roots are key to my identity. I was born in India, and I moved to the US when I was 9 years old back in 2005. Fast forward to nine years later, in 2014 I became the second person in my family to attend college—following my sister.</p>
											<p>I did my Bachelors’ in Biomedical Engineering from Rutgers University, where I graduated from in 2018 with a Magna Cum Laude distinction. I had initially aspired to attend medical school, but somewhere during my undergraduate program, I developed a passion for data and programming. This passion was rooted in my engineering coursework, along with the academic projects I had the chance to work on with a few of my BME professors. </p>
											<p>Following my completion of my undergraduate degree, I worked for a small biotech company as a Product Development Scientist. Having decided against pursuing Medical School, I started developing my programming and data-science skills through projects and online classes&mdash;such as <strong>Machine Learning A-Z on Udemy</strong>, and the famed <strong>FastAi course</strong>. In January 2019, I enrolled into the Masters&rsquo; in Data Science program at NJIT.</p>
											<p>This portfolio is a collection of my work, both in and out of school, through which I aim to showcase my skills and abilities.</p>
